Hi there, this is a python notebook where you can visualize orthogonal projection
Feel free to interact with it :)

How to use: 
1. Cltr + Enter to run the first cell
2. Enter your plane equation and rotation degree in x, y, z axes
3. Get your result for rotated plane
4. Cltr + Enter run the second cell
5. Get your projection
